# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
In this module we were given a dataset and had to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by AlphabetSoup. 

##Results

For this project we were trying to find how likely a company is to succeed in order to receive funding from Alphabet Soup.

Some of the variables we used from the dataset were: 
- Income amount
- Ask amount
- Application Type
- Special Considerations

Some of the variables we removed from the dataset were:
- Name
- EIN
